<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project 1: Tic tac toe

Remember Tic Tac Toe? See Wikipedia if you can’t remember the rules, or if you haven’t ever played. It involves a couple of players, a simple board, checking for victory in a game loop… all the conditions that make it a fun little problem to solve using our newfound OOP sea legs. Let’s build it!

Assignment 1

Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.
